# Solidity Mastery ⛓️

Welcome to my repository showcasing smart contracts I’ve developed and tested. All contracts are written and initially tested in Remix to ensure proper functionality. Once verified, they are pushed to this repository to demonstrate my proficiency in smart contract development.


###   Categories of Smart Contracts:

- Custom Contracts <br>
Smart contracts  tailored for integration with other decentralized applications (dApps).

- ERC-20 Tokens <br>
Standard implementations and custom modifications of ERC-20 token contracts.

- NFTs (ERC-721/1155) <br>
Smart contracts for creating, managing, and trading non-fungible tokens.

- Governance <br>
Contracts designed for decentralized governance systems.



- DeFi <br>
Smart contracts for decentralized finance, including staking, yield farming, and liquidity pools.


### Testing & Deployment:
All smart contracts are written and thoroughly tested in Remix IDE. Once confirmed to be functional and secure, they are pushed to this repository for reference.
